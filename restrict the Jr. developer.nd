How to restrict a Junior Developer to work only on a feature branch in Git, especially if you're using a Git hosting service like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. These platforms allow you to set branch permissions to control access. 
Here’s how you can manage this restriction:

### 1. **Set Branch Protection Rules**
   On platforms like GitHub or GitLab, you can protect branches (like `main` or `develop`) so that only certain users or roles have permission to push or merge into them.

   - **GitHub**: Go to your repository, navigate to **Settings > Branches**, and add branch protection rules for the main or protected branches. You can restrict access by specifying who can push or merge to those branches.
   - **GitLab**: Go to your repository, navigate to **Settings > Repository > Protected Branches**, and set the permissions for each branch.

   With this setup, only designated team members (e.g., senior developers or team leads) will have write access to `main` or `develop` branches, while Junior Developers can still work on `feature` branches and create pull requests.

### 2. **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   If your Git platform supports Role-Based Access Control, you can assign roles that define access levels across branches. This method allows you to define roles with permissions tailored to Junior Developers, ensuring they can push to feature branches but not to production branches.

### 3. **Use Git Hooks for Local Repositories**
   If you’re managing Git permissions locally, you can use a pre-push or pre-commit hook to restrict pushes to certain branches based on the user’s role or configuration.

   For example, you can add a `pre-push` hook in the `.git/hooks/` directory of the developer’s local repository:
   ```bash
   # .git/hooks/pre-push
   branch="$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"
   if [[ "$branch" != "feature-branch" ]]; then
       echo "You are only allowed to push to the feature-branch."
       exit 1
   fi
   ```
   This approach requires manual setup on each developer's machine, so it's best used in smaller teams or for local testing.

### 4. **Restrict Pull Requests for Merging**
   Encourage your team to use pull requests for merging changes into protected branches. Set up a policy where only approved users can review and merge pull requests into `main` or `develop` branches. This way, Junior Developers will need approval from senior team members to merge their changes.

Using these approaches ensures that Junior Developers focus only on the feature branches and don’t accidentally push to critical branches.
