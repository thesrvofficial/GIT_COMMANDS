### Git and GitHub Interview Questions

This document is divided into three sections to comprehensively cover interview questions on Git and GitHub: **Direct Questions**, **Troubleshooting Questions**, and **Scenario-Based Questions**.

---

## **Section 1: Direct Questions**

These questions focus on fundamental Git and GitHub concepts.

### **Basic Questions**
1. **What is Git, and how is it different from GitHub?**
   - Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code.
   - GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories.

2. **What is a repository in Git?**
   - A repository is a directory or storage space where your code and its history are stored.

3. **What is the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`?**
   - `git pull` fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into your current branch.
   - `git fetch` only downloads the changes without merging them.

4. **What are the different types of branches in Git?**
   - Main branches (`main`, `master`).
   - Feature branches (e.g., `feature/new-feature`).
   - Release branches (e.g., `release/v1.0`).
   - Hotfix branches (e.g., `hotfix/critical-bug`).

5. **What is the purpose of `git stash`?**
   - Temporarily saves changes in the working directory without committing them, allowing you to work on something else.

6. **What is the difference between `git reset` and `git revert`?**
   - `git reset` rewrites commit history, potentially removing commits.
   - `git revert` creates a new commit to undo the changes introduced by a previous commit.

7. **Explain the three states of a Git file.**
   - **Modified**: The file has been changed but not staged.
   - **Staged**: The file is prepared for the next commit.
   - **Committed**: The file is safely stored in the repository.

8. **What is a detached HEAD state in Git?**
   - It occurs when `HEAD` points to a specific commit instead of a branch, often used for reviewing past commits.

9. **What is a `git tag`, and how is it different from a branch?**
   - A tag is a reference to a specific commit (usually used for releases).
   - Unlike a branch, a tag does not move with new commits.

10. **What is the difference between `git merge` and `git rebase`?**
    - `git merge` integrates changes from one branch into another, creating a merge commit.
    - `git rebase` rewrites the commit history to apply changes on top of another branch.

## **Section 2: Troubleshooting Questions**

These questions test your ability to identify and resolve common Git issues.

### **Merge Conflicts**
1. **What is a merge conflict, and how do you resolve it?**
   - A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically reconcile changes. It is resolved by manually editing the conflicting files, staging the changes, and completing the merge.

2. **How do you abort a merge in Git?**
   ```bash
   git merge --abort
   ```

3. **How do you check for conflicts before merging?**
   - Use:
     ```bash
     git fetch
     git diff <branch-name>
     ```

---

### **Accidental Commits**
4. **How do you undo the last commit?**
   - To keep changes:
     ```bash
     git reset --soft HEAD~1
     ```
   - To discard changes:
     ```bash
     git reset --hard HEAD~1
     ```

5. **How do you recover a deleted branch?**
   ```bash
   git reflog
   git checkout -b <branch-name> <commit-hash>
   ```

---

### **Lost Changes**
6. **What happens if you lose changes after a hard reset?**
   - You can recover changes using `git reflog` to find the previous commit.

---

### **Untracked Files**
7. **How do you clean up untracked files and directories?**
   ```bash
   git clean -f -d
   ```

---

### **Push and Pull Issues**
8. **What do you do if you accidentally push to the wrong branch?**
   - Undo the push with:
     ```bash
     git reset --hard origin/main
     git push --force
     ```

9. **How do you resolve conflicts when pulling changes from a remote repository?**
   - Use:
     ```bash
     git pull --rebase origin main
     ```
   - Resolve conflicts and continue the rebase:
     ```bash
     git rebase --continue
     ```

---

## **Section 3: Scenario-Based Questions**

These questions focus on applying Git commands to real-world situations.

### **Collaboration**
1. **Scenario**: Multiple developers are working on the same file. How would you manage and integrate their changes without conflicts?
   - Solution:
     - Encourage frequent `git pull` or `git fetch` commands.
     - Use feature branches.
     - Resolve conflicts during merges or rebases.

2. **Scenario**: You need to test an experimental feature without affecting the `main` branch.
   - Solution:
     - Create a new branch:
       ```bash
       git checkout -b experiment
       ```
     - Commit changes and test the feature.

---

### **Code Recovery**
3. **Scenario**: You accidentally delete a branch. How do you recover it?
   - Solution:
     - Find the branchâ€™s last commit:
       ```bash
       git reflog
       ```
     - Create the branch again:
       ```bash
       git checkout -b <branch-name> <commit-hash>
       ```

4. **Scenario**: You commit sensitive information (e.g., API keys). How do you remove it from history?
   - Solution:
     ```bash
     git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
       "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch <file>" --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
     ```
   - Force push the changes:
     ```bash
     git push --force
     ```

---

### **Version Control**
5. **Scenario**: You need to apply a specific commit from another branch to the current branch.
   - Solution:
     - Use `git cherry-pick`:
       ```bash
       git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
       ```

---

### **Release Management**
6. **Scenario**: You want to create a release version for your project.
   - Solution:
     - Create a tag:
       ```bash
       git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release version 1.0"
       ```
     - Push the tag to the remote:
       ```bash
       git push origin v1.0
       ```

---

### **CI/CD Integration**
7. **Scenario**: Your team uses CI/CD pipelines. How do you integrate Git for automated builds?
   - Solution:
     - Configure the pipeline to trigger on branch updates.
     - Use Git commands like `git pull` to fetch the latest code and run automated tests.
