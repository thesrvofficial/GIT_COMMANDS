In Git, there isn't a direct timestamp on each line of code, but you can identify when a specific line was last modified using the `git blame` command, which shows the commit where each line was changed, along with the author and date.

Here’s how to check which line changed most recently using `git blame`:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Identify the Last Change on a Line

1. **Use `git blame` on the file**  
   This command shows the author, commit hash, and date for each line of a file. Run:
   ```bash
   git blame example.txt
   ```

2. **Interpret the Output**  
   For each line, `git blame` provides information like this:
   ```text
   f9b2e8d7 (John Doe 2024-11-04 14:32:23 +0200) This is a change in the main branch.
   ```
   - **Commit hash** (`f9b2e8d7`): The commit where this line was last modified.
   - **Author** (`John Doe`): The person who made the change.
   - **Date and time** (`2024-11-04 14:32:23 +0200`): The exact time of the change.

3. **Identify Recent Changes**  
   To see the most recent change for a specific line, locate the latest date on that line. You can scroll through the `git blame` output or use `grep` to search for specific keywords if you know which line you're interested in.

### Advanced Tips

- **To track a specific line’s history**  
   If you want to track changes to a specific line number over time, note the line’s content or commit hash and then use:
   ```bash
   git log -L <start-line>,<end-line>:<file-path>
   ```
   For example, to see changes to line 5 in `example.txt`:
   ```bash
   git log -L 5,5:example.txt
   ```

This will show a log of commits affecting line 5, including timestamps and changes in that line.
